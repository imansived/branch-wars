# Branch Wars 👑

A 2048-style tile-merging game themed around the Indian engineering "branch wars" —
merge your way from Civil up through Mech, Instru, E&TC, Robotics, AI&DS, IT, and
finally CS. Merge two CS tiles to trigger placement season and find out your fate.

Built with React + Vite. Sound effects are synthesized live with the Web Audio API —
no external audio files.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # local dev server
npm run build    # production build → dist/
npm run preview  # preview the production build

## Architecture notes

- **`game/` is framework-agnostic.** `gridLogic.js` and `events.js` contain zero
  React — pure functions in, pure data out. They could be lifted into a Node
  test suite or a different UI framework without changes.
- **`hooks/useGameState.js` is the only place game state lives.** `App.jsx` is
  pure layout — it destructures what it needs from the hook and renders. This
  keeps the render tree easy to scan and the state machine easy to unit-test
  in isolation.
- **`audio/sfx.js` is self-contained.** All sounds are synthesized with
  oscillators (no audio files to host). It exposes `SFX` (the sound library)
  and `unlockAudio()` (call once on first user gesture — works around mobile
  Safari/Chrome silently dropping the first sound on a page).
- **`data/` holds all copy and config**, so editing roast lines, colors, or
  event text never requires touching component code.

## Customizing

- **Add/edit roast lines or branch colors** → `src/data/branches.js`
- **Add/edit a college event** → `src/data/flavorText.js` (`COLLEGE_EVENTS`)
  and, if it needs a new gameplay effect, `src/game/events.js`
- **Change a sound** → `src/audio/sfx.js`
- **Change the event firing frequency** → `EVENT_INTERVAL_MIN` /
  `EVENT_INTERVAL_RANGE` in `src/hooks/useGameState.js` (currently fires every
  25–40 successful moves)
